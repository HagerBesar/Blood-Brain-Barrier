# Blood-Brain-Barrier
Predicting the ability of chemical species to cross the bloodâˆ’brain barrier (BBB) 
is an active field of research for development and mechanistic understanding in the pharmaceutical industry.
Here, we report the BBB permeability of a large data set of compounds by incorporating molecular solvation energy descriptors
computed by the 3D-RISM-KH molecular solvation theory.
